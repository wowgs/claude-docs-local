# Changelog

One section per version, newest first. A change to the structure of the user config or of `docsync.json` is a breaking change (major version) and its section has **Migration (for the model)**: what to change in the user's files during setup.

## 2.0.1 — 2026-10-13

The marketplace takes both plugins from `master`; a release is a new `version` in `plugin.json` (README).

## 2.0.0 — 2026-10-13

Installed as two plugins from the `wowgs` marketplace instead of a git clone in `~/.claude/skills`; Claude Code fetches and updates them.

- `docs-local` (on everywhere): the `/docs-local` command, `docsync` on Claude's PATH, the hook, setup.
- `docs-local-files` (on only in projects with local docs, through `enabledPlugins` in the project's `.claude/settings.local.json`): the skill with the workflow and the file format.
- Gone: `docsync update`, `VERSION`, setup writing into SKILL.md. `project check` returns the sync rule of the chosen mode.
- The `docsync` shell command is a small script that runs the installed plugin's copy, since its path changes with every version.

Config schema stays 1; the user config loses `"update"`.

**Migration (for the model):** SETUP.md, "Install", step 2 deletes the 1.x folder, and `docsync setup claude` replaces what 1.x wrote into Claude Code's settings (the `skillOverrides` entry and the hook in each project).

## 1.0.0 — 2026-10-13

First version.

Config schema 1:

- User config (`~/.config/docsync/config.json`): `{"schema": 1, "sync": "user" | "model", "projects": [<project root>, …], "update": {…}}`. The only list of projects; a project root holds its `docsync.json` and the Claude Code settings `.claude/settings.local.json`.
- Project config (`docsync.json` at a project root): `{"schema": 1, "name": "<project name>", "docs": {"<folder>": {"id": "<doc id>", "name": "<doc name>"} | null}}`.
